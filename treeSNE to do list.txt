treeSNE to do list

save parfor1 outputs in different directory
do local_density calcs on basis of used_markers, but save all_markers
add description of parameters to runs file

parfor_1_read_individual_fcs_get_downsampling_info_treeSNE
- saves all data, all marker_names, index of used_markers




for_3_Prepare_DataForSPADE_treeSNE
 - adjust local_density to take into account downsampling

add extra_markers during for2
remember to save it again during for3
in for_4, replace is_marker_selected with used_markers, also add extra_markers to saved elements
in group_..., take used_markers and extra_markers as inputs, adapt
